            <p style=" padding: 20px; padding-top: 0; text-align: justify;"> Ganesh Chaturthi is the most iconic and widely celebrated festival in Maharashtra. Dedicated to Lord Ganesha, it marks
            his birth and is celebrated with immense devotion and grandeur, especially in Mumbai and Pune. The festival lasts for 10
            days, beginning with the installation of beautifully crafted Ganpati idols in homes and public pandals.
            
            Devotees perform aarti (prayer), sing bhajans, and offer modaks, believed to be Lord Ganesha’s favorite sweet. Streets
            are filled with processions, lights, music, and community celebrations. Cultural programs, social awareness campaigns,
            and competitions are also held during this time.
            
            The highlight is the visarjan (immersion) on the final day, where idols are taken in grand processions and immersed in
            rivers or the sea with chants of “Ganpati Bappa Morya, Pudhchya Varshi Lavkar Ya”.
            
            Ganesh Chaturthi, started publicly by Lokmanya Tilak during the freedom movement, is more than a religious event—it’s a
            social and cultural unifier. It brings together people from all walks of life in celebration, prayer, and joy

            <h3 style="padding: 20px; padding-bottom: 0px;">🌟 Diwali</h3>
            <p style=" padding: 20px; padding-top: 0px; text-align: justify;"> Diwali, the Festival of Lights, is celebrated with great enthusiasm across Maharashtra. It marks the victory of light
            over darkness and good over evil. Diwali begins with Vasu Baras and Dhanteras, followed by Narak Chaturdashi, Lakshmi
            Pujan, Padwa, and Bhaubeej, each day having cultural and spiritual significance.
            
            Homes are cleaned and decorated with diyas (oil lamps), colorful rangoli, and flowers. Firecrackers light up the night
            sky. On Lakshmi Pujan, families worship Goddess Lakshmi, the deity of wealth, for prosperity and well-being.
            
            Traditional sweets like karanji, chakli, laddu, and shankarpali are prepared and shared. Diwali also includes gifting,
            new clothes, and exchanging warm wishes. For Maharashtrians, Padwa is celebrated as Bali Pratipada, symbolizing the
            return of King Bali to earth, while Bhaubeej highlights the special bond between brothers and sisters.
            
            Diwali in Maharashtra is not just a religious festival; it’s a vibrant celebration of life, culture, and togetherness.

            <h3 style="padding: 20px; padding-bottom: 0px;">🌟 Gudi Padwa</h3>
            <p style=" padding: 20px; padding-top: 0; text-align: justify;">Gudi Padwa is the Maharashtrian New Year, celebrated on the first day of the Chaitra month (March-April). It signifies
            the beginning of spring and the harvest season, as well as the mythical victory of Lord Rama over Ravana.
            
            The hallmark of the festival is the Gudi—a decorated bamboo stick with a bright cloth, mango leaves, a garland, and an
            inverted copper or silver pot—hoisted outside homes. It symbolizes victory, prosperity, and protection.
            
            Families wake up early, clean their houses, take oil baths, and decorate the entrance with rangoli. Special dishes like
            shrikhand, puran poli, and soonth panak are prepared. People dress in traditional attire—women in sarees and men in
            kurta-pajama with a pheta (turban).
            
            Gudi Padwa is also a day of astrological importance and is considered highly auspicious to start new ventures. It’s a
            day of cultural pride for Maharashtrians, marking renewal and positivity.

            <h3 style="padding: 20px; padding-bottom: 0px;">🌟 Makar Sankranti</h3>
            <p style=" padding: 20px; padding-top: 0px; text-align: justify;"> Makar Sankranti is a harvest festival celebrated in mid-January to mark the sun’s transition into Capricorn (Makara
            Rashi). In Maharashtra, it’s a festival of gratitude, charity, and sweetness.
            
            People exchange tilgul—sesame and jaggery sweets—with the words “Tilgul ghya, god god bola”, meaning “Accept this sweet
            and speak sweetly.” These ingredients symbolize warmth during the cold season and bonding in relationships.
            
            Women celebrate Haldi-Kumkum, inviting married women to their homes for rituals and gifting. Children fly colorful kites
            in the sky, and competitions are held in towns and villages.
            
            The festival emphasizes unity and kindness. It’s also associated with giving donations (daan) to the needy and wearing
            black clothes to absorb warmth.
            
            Makar Sankranti in Maharashtra combines spiritual significance, social bonding, and the joy of harvest, making it a
            unique and meaningful celebration.

                <h3 style="padding: 20px; padding-bottom: 0px;">🌟 Janmashtami – Celebration of Lord Krishna’s Birth
                </h3>
                <p style=" padding: 20px; padding-top: 0; text-align: justify;">Janmashtami, also known as Gokulashtami in Maharashtra, celebrates the birth of Lord Krishna, the eighth avatar of
                Vishnu. Observed in the month of Shravan (August), this festival is especially popular in Mumbai, Thane, Pune, and
                across the Konkan region.
                
                One of the most iconic aspects of Janmashtami in Maharashtra is the Dahi Handi celebration. It recreates Lord Krishna’s
                childhood act of stealing butter (makhan). Young boys, called Govindas, form human pyramids to break a high-hanging
                earthen pot filled with curd, butter, or dry fruits—often accompanied by cheering crowds and energetic music.
                
                The event is full of thrill and team spirit. Communities and sponsors organize large-scale Dahi Handi competitions with
                prize money and safety measures, attracting both local groups and professional teams.
                
                At homes and temples, devotees fast, sing bhajans, and perform midnight aarti, marking the exact time of Krishna’s
                birth. Krishna idols are bathed, dressed in new clothes, and placed in decorated cradles.
                
                Sweets like pedha, shrikhanda, and makkhan mishri are prepared and offered to the deity. The festival blends devotion,
                joy, physical activity, and cultural pride, especially for the youth.
                
                Janmashtami in Maharashtra is not just a spiritual observance; it’s a colorful, community-centered event that showcases
                the energy, devotion, and vibrant culture of the state.</p>
